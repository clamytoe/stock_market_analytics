### Anaconda setup

If you are an Anaconda user, this command will get you up to speed with the base installation.

```zsh
conda env create
conda activate stocks
```

### Regular Python setup

If you are just using normal Python, this will get you ready, but I highly recommend that you do this in a virtual environment.
There are many ways to do this, the simplest using *venv*.

```zsh
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
